### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  const availableValue  = Number(availableTime);
  if (hungry) {
    if (availableValue < 20)  {
      console.log("Please pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen, where you can get to know your fellow classmates!");
    } else if  ((availableValue >=  20)  &&  (availableValue <=  30)) {
      console.log("Congrats you are ahead of your schedule!Try some Carnitas from Tacofino in Gastown.");
    } else if (availableValue > 30) {
      console.log("I suggest you should probably reconsider your breaktime!");
    }
  } else  {
    console.log("Wait till you are hungry!");
  }
 
};
```
